  /**
   * @brief Set of hits with a 2D structure
   *
   * A cluster is a set of reconstructed hits supposed to originate from the
   * same physical entity.
   * A cluster lies in a single plane (of a single TPC).
   * 
   * Clusters provide the base of reconstructed 3D objects: tracks and showers.
   * The cluster class contains information that helps characterizing the
   * originating particle and discriminating its signature as track-like
   * or shower-like.
   * 
   * A cluster is supposed to describe the reconstruction of a transiting
   * particle, and can therefore be thought as having a start, the location
   * where it is first seen in time, and an end, the location where it is seen
   * last. In practice, it is often hard to determine by the shape which
   * tip is which, and in case of showers the end might be hard to determine.
   * As a consequence, although the two tips are called "start" and "end", their
   * order is not unerringly; the tip labelled "start" is still deemed to be
   * more likely the beginning of the cluster rather than the end.
   * In the extreme case the "end" should be considered just as an alternative
   * cluster start.
   * 
   * @note A cluster lives in a plane of inhomogeneous coordinates: wire number
   * and tick number. Different ways to make them homogeneous are available.
   * For example, knowing the drift velocity (assuming it constant) and the wire
   * pitch, it is possible to convert both coordinates in a measure of distance.
   * Where the wire and time coordinates need to be compared, they are
   * converted into physical distances. Wire coordinate includes the wire pitch
   * information and it can be defined as the distance (in centimetres) from the
   * wire #0 (and negative if it lies on the opposite side than wire #0 with
   * respect to wire #0) of the point. The tick coordinate is converted into
   * a distance from the wire plane (in centimetres) by including the drift
   * velocity. The absolute time for which this coordinate is 0 is defined to
   * be as an "absolute trigger time". This is still ambiguous enough, but
   * matter of fact there should be no need of absolute wire or tick coordinates
   * but only of their difference; for example, to define angles, dT/dW (or some
   * similar quantity) is used.
   * More advanced knowledge of the geometry or status of the detector may lead
   * to different wire pitch or drift velocity: in that case, these quantities
   * need to be recomputed, although it is conceivable that the ones with simple
   * constant pitch and drift are often an approximation close enough.
